Experimental data from a pedestrian bridge on Georgia Tech campus is used for demonstrating the model updating procedure. The main frame of the pedestrian bridge is made of steel, and the bridge deck is made of concrete.  A total of 58 acceleration channels are measured. The first five extracted modes are used for model updating. The folloiwng figure shows the locations of entries in psiExp_m on the steel bridge.
