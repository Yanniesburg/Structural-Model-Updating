1. Four-Story Analytical Structure - Simulated Data

A four-story shear frame structure is simulated. In the initial model, the nominal weight and inter-story stiffness values of all floors are set as 12.060 lb and 10 lbf/in, respectively. To construct an “as-built” structure, the stiffness value of the fourth story is reduced by 10% to 9 lbf/in, as shown in the figure below. Modal properties of the “as-built” structure are directly used as “experimental” modal properties. It is assumed that only the first three floors are instrumented with sensors and only the first mode is “measured” and available for model updating.

2. Four-Story Laboratory Structure - Experimental Data

Experimental data from a laboratory 4-story shear frame structure is used for demonstrating the model updating procedure. Floor masses are accurately weighed, but all four inter-story stiffness values require updating. The structure is mounted on a shake table which provides base excitation for the structure. Accelerometers are installed on the base (#0) and floors (#1~#3). Modal properties of the four-story structure are then extracted from the experimental data. The first and the second extracted modes are used for model updating.
