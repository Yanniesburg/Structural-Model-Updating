A four-story shear frame structure is simulated. In the initial model, the nominal weight and inter-story stiffness values of all floors are set as 12.060 lb and 10 lbf/in, respectively. To construct an ¡°as-built¡± structure, the stiffness value of the fourth story is reduced by 10% to 9 lbf/in, as shown in the figure below. Modal properties of the ¡°as-built¡± structure are directly used as ¡°experimental¡± modal properties. It is assumed that only the first three floors are instrumented with sensors and only the first mode is ¡°measured¡± and available for model updating. The first resonance frequency and the ¡°measured¡± (instrumented) three mode shape entries are ¦Ø_1=6.196 "rad/s"  and ¦×_m=(0.395,0.742,1.000)^T, respectively.
